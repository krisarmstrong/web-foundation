All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.8.0] - 2025-11-15

## [0.9.0] - 2025-11-15

### Added
- ContactForm component with spam protection, offline messaging, and tone/background theming so Wi-Fi Vigilante and krisarmstrong.org can share the exact same UX with one source of truth.
- Tailwind/PostCSS pipeline plus Storybook dark/light themes (`src/styles/storybook.css`) so components render identically to production.
- Storybook stories for the new ContactForm and CSS import so Chromatic/QA can validate every primitive.

### Changed
- Button gained an `emerald` tone and the existing `sage` theme reuses the shared emerald palette for consistency across brands.
- Storybook config now relies on explicit addon packages (`addon-docs`, `addon-a11y`, `addon-vitest`, `addon-onboarding`) instead of the removed `addon-essentials` meta package.

### Added
- Theme-aware tokens (`themeTokens`) and optional `theme` props across layout primitives (PageShell, Footer, Breadcrumbs, NavCard, Card, PageHeader) so components render correctly in both dark and light palettes out of the box.
- New `sage` tone for primary buttons, plus typography defaults that now read from CSS variables, allowing ThemeProvider overrides without manual class overrides.

### Changed
- Footer, Breadcrumbs, PageShell, NavCard, and Card now rely on CSS variables/inline styles derived from theme tokens instead of baked-in gray backgrounds, enabling Intrinsic Momentum Mindset and other light-brand sites to consume the shared UI kit without hand-patching styles.
